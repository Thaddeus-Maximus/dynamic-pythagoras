What if you could use the power of modern musical instruments (speakers, cough cough) to generate music that obeyed simple fractional ratios between notes, at the expense of not having 'A' always be 'A'; e.g. you pick a starting note and 'go up or down' from there. Sortof like Byzantine notation. I expect this would sound wild.

"just use your voice" yeah, I want to know for sure that I'm hitting the mathematically correct frequencies.
